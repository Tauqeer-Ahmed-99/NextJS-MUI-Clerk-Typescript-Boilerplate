# Next.js + MUI + Clerk Auth + TypeScript Boilerplate

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped using [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/HEAD/packages/create-next-app), with [Material UI](https://mui.com/) and [Clerk Authentication](https://clerk.dev/) integrated, and written in TypeScript.

## Features

    - Next.js: A fast React framework with optimized server-side rendering and static site generation.
    - Material UI: A popular React UI framework for building responsive and accessible user interfaces.
    - Clerk Authentication: A complete user management and authentication solution, easily integrated with Next.js.
    - TypeScript: Provides static typing to catch errors early and improve code maintainability.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
